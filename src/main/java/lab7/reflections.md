1. Explain the aspects of the design of your program that allow lambda expressions and/or anonymous classes to be used to test your searchRecipes function. Your discussion should include terms such as the following: dependency injection, mock, interface, polymorphism, couple/decouple.

Ans:
Because my program has been constructed to depend on interfaces rather than actual classes, the searchRecipes function may be tested using anonymous classes and lambda expressions.  The function separates the search algorithm from any particular data source, such SQLite, by accepting a DataService as a parameter (dependency injection).  This makes it possible for tests to supply controlled, hardcoded recipe data using fake objects that implement the DataService interface.  Real and mock DataService objects can be provided to searchRecipes without changing the function's code because of polymorphism.  All things considered, this approach separates processing logic from data access, increasing the code's flexibility, testability, and maintainability.
